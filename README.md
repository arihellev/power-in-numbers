# power-in-numbers
Power in Numbers is a generative text project that randomly spits out up to date COVID-19 statistics for New York City. All live data has been compiled from the nychealth COVID-19 github (https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) posted on the official nyc.gov website (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page). The data presented below reflect the most recent information the Health Department has collected about people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in NYC as of April 6, 2020. They are discouraging people with mild to moderate symptoms from being tested at this time, so the data primarily represent people with more severe illness. This project represents how we can drown in data and information and feel detached from the humanity behind the numbers.
